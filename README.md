# Loan-repayment-predictor
This project will predict whether a loan receiving candidate will be able to repay the loan or not using the Decision tree model in machine learning.

1. first we will load all the neccessary libraries and data set
2. Then we will wrangle some data and will exclude the columns that are not necessary to evaluate or train the model.
3. Then we will train the Decision Tree model with approximately 30% of data from the dataset.
4. Finally we will predict whether the loan will be repayble or not  using the model we have trained.
